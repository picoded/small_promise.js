# What is small_promise.js ?

An as lightweight as possible Promise API implementation as per MDN documentation. (Not the full ES6 / APlus specs).

Because IE do not support this feature.

# Will this be blazing fast ?

NO. This is meant to be a super small polyfill. It should be reasonably fast, but no promises.
